# 🌚🙋🏾‍♀️Simnikiwe Sangoni,

**`Elevating Minds, Crafting Code: Coding Enthusiast and Language Tutor on a Mission to Merge Passion with Precision in Software Development and Machine Learning.`**

### I am a passionate coder hailing from the vibrant landscapes of South Africa. 🇿🇦 Currently on a software development coding journey at CodeSpace, blending my love for software development with a background in aeronautical engineering. 💻✈️ When not immersed in code, you might find me tutoring math, history, English, science, and even Mandarin. 📚🌐 I thrive on order, structure, and the thrill of solving problems with a touch of Python magic. 

### My overarching goal is to continually enhance my skills in software development while sharing knowledge with a global community. Committed to fostering an environment of growth, I aspire to inspire and contribute to the collective journey of continuous improvement within the coding and teaching realms." 🌱📚💡

### Let's build something incredible together! 🚀✨
